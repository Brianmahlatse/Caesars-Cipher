ROT13 Cipher Decoder

This is a JavaScript function that decodes a string that has been encoded using the ROT13 cipher. The ROT13 cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts the letters of a string by 13 positions in the alphabet. It is a widely known cipher and is commonly used to obscure text for email and message board postings, as well as for obscuring movie spoilers and other online content.

The function takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string. All letters in the input string will be uppercase, and all non-alphabetic characters (such as spaces and punctuation) will be left unchanged. The function makes use of the getAlphabets(), position(), and rot13() functions defined in the code to perform the decoding.
